# Scala guide by ohnosequences!

This repository contains some guidelines for advanced Scala programming. It's a normal sbt-project with code examples that are used in the documentation in the [docs/](docs/) folder. It is then transformed to a static gitbook-site: [ohnosequences.com/scala-guide](http://ohnosequences.com/scala-guide).
